    By Joe Horbatch
    <p class="article">
      Christopher Nolan’s, <i>The Dark Knight</i>, is one of the pinnacle achievements in modern film
  history – it successfully builds on the treasured world of Gotham that Christopher Nolan had brought to
  life with Batman Begins and throws us into the crime riddled world that the Joker has engineered. The
  true treat of the movie, other than seeing Christian Bale kick ass as Batman, is the genius work of Heath
  Ledger. From the first moment he appears on the screen, he uniquely captures attention of both the
  moviegoers and the characters on the screen. The antithesis of Batman is the Joker, a yin and yang
  shaping Gotham into the most polarizing city in the history of comics. You flip a coin one day and you
  win an experience with <i>The Dark Knight</i>. Another day, you may get the rough end of the Joker’s
  retribution. It’s the constant, heads vs. tails battle that creates a dance of fates. And that coin flip is where
  we find Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart is (especially in 2008) a god damn national treasure – and for those who
  are not familiar with his work, you might recognize him in this movie as Harvey Dent.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      While some see <i>The Dark Knight</i> as a battle between good and evil on the surface, the movie at its core is
about the golden goose of Gotham. Bruce Wayne’s main goal as Batman is. Harvey Dent represents the
true strength of the justice system – a bastion who could never yield to anything except the truth, which is
exactly why Wayne is so obsessed with seeing him succeed. Dent can change the city in a way that he had
never dreamed possible. The Joker sees Harvey Dent as a challenge – knowing full well Dent’s meaning
to Batman, he stops at nothing to knock him out of his high heights. We know the Joker eventually
succeeds in turning Harvey into Two Face – famously fulfilling the quote earlier in the movie from
Harvey himself, <a class="video-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WfRcnF4iZI&t=0s">“you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.”</a>
Throughout this war – we find Eckhart. Aaron plays Harvey Dent and Two Face masterfully as he commands the same respect
as Ledger while on screen. With a jaw like an anvil and a presence like a B-52, I thought he was destined
to be mentioned in the same breath as Leo or Pitt.
    </p>

      It all went up in a puff of smoke when I saw <i>Battle: Los Angeles</i>. This movie – god bless America. In
between the constant military stereotypes, there is a battle with asteroids and aliens and something about
water. It’s all horribly confusing, the marines save the word, and it ends. No explanation, little exploring,
and a very poorly-executed product were the unfortunate ingredients that left a sour taste in all true
moviegoers’ mouths. The movie was really quite an interesting idea, but this supreme failure of a movie
cemented the fact that I knew nothing about the world. How could anyone have given the green light for
such a disappointment? Did the studio who wrote the check have a heart attack when they saw the initial
screening? As much as I thought Eckhart was deserving of more leading roles post 2008, the fact
remained that this movie was a colossal flop. My favorite actor was to be forever relegated to the B-team,
and the rest of his career has been a bitter reflection of this missed opportunity of a movie.

      When I think about the Battle for Los Angeles, I don’t want to think about this movie. I want gripping
NBA action to cement this brutal pothole in my brain over half a dozen times to ensure it’s in the deepest
darkest pit, right next to the mullet years and only to be accessed via some deep, deep hypnosis.
    </p>

      Can the new Battle: Los Angeles (At Disney World) undo the devastating and negative connotations of
the phrase? The Lakers and Clippers match up has all the makings of a star-powered showdown, and
there’s no doubt that the players will leaving nothing behind on the court. LeBron vs. Kawhai. Anthony
Davis vs. Paul George. LA vs LA. But is it possible that these two conflicts have a deeper parallel than
their name? Let’s dive in for a moment.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      One of the most compelling parts of this NBA story almost has nothing to do with the basketball being
  played on the court. The league has not only led the other professional sports leagues on the cutting edge
  of a corona virus response, but it has basically paved the path forward for the entire American economy.
  When the NBA decided to close its doors in mid-March, it was the first major industry to finally heed the
  call, ultimately putting health and safety first. And almost immediately all the other dominoes fell behind
  – resulting in one of the greatest free falls the stock market had seen in a few generations. Adam Silver
  and the league deserve credit for leading by example, but it is also worth exploring how we are
  reintroduced to our favorite sport.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      With such a long absence, it’s almost unfair to call this restart anything other than a brand-new season.
  The normal summer break lasts for about five months for teams who make the playoffs – by the time the
  league jumps off again it will have been almost as long since the players hit the court. Will we even see
  cohesive basketball being played? Hard to imagine. The players don’t forget how to play in a couple of
  months, but there are several factors to consider with the playoffs starting after the ~10 regular season
  games.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      1. LeBron James has COVID-19. Or some facsimile thereof. Star players will eventually have to sit out
due to Coronavirus – despite the best efforts of everyone involved, it is all but guaranteed that a big name
will catch Covid during a critical stretch in the 2020* season. Do you want to watch the Rockets without
Harden or the Bucks without Giannas? Forget for a moment their larger than life personalities and think
of how the games are impacted when they are off the court: it simply isn’t the same, the on-screen product
just can’t be matched. Will the audiences still tune-in for a lesser version of the same product?
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      2. Players have the option to opt themselves out. J.R. Smith is back in the league. How long before we see
Ray Allen, Shaq or even the GOAT tie up their sneakers and sign with teams when players, who had
worked on their chemistry with their teammates and coaches all season long, opt out? I am giddy with the
thought that we could see some old names and faces return to the hardwood – but the thought of losing
out on cohesive basketball fills me with dread. There can be something said about seeing new players and
how hard they try, but the fact that talent wins out in this sport means that we won’t be cheering for the
same teams in the abbreviated season that we grew to love early in the year – the backup players will
simply turn this game into a worse version of the same product (i.e. RC COLA).
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      3. Disney World is haunted. There are enough ghost stories written about the Native American lands that
  the theme park was built on and about the executives’ blood sacrifices over time to prove one conclusion
  – where there is smoke there is fire. How long before an extended stay at Mickey Mouse land will it take
  before our isolated superstars start to find out the hidden truths? And once they know, will they ever be
  able to play with the same vigor again?
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      The horrible truth is that it’s hard to fathom that players will be up-to-snuff with only a handful of games
to iron out the kinks before the playoffs start. We might see a style of basketball that is less akin to the
NBA we remember and more like March Madness. The fineness and the flair may be there, but I would
bet every 48 minute match up turns into the slug and grind fests that college fans adore. It’s more likely
that we see the NBA style with a lower shooting percentage. Lower scoring games = less excitement = a
mediocre product.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      If there’s one thing I KNOW to be true, it’s that a bad product, once released, is bad forever. There is no
going back to the drawing board once you unleash it to the world – for good or bad people will remember
that first glimpse back into the limelight. We see it all the time with video games, late night TV ads, and
blockbuster Hollywood movies. And we have seen it time and time again, where executives rush bad
movies through to hit the market at the calculated time – only to watch their investment go up in smoke.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Will the classic Hollywood mentality of shipping out the stars in front of a pile of garbage hurt the league
AND the players long term? If you ask Eckhart, I’d give a good wager that he would have liked to review
Battle: Los Angeles and see the finish product before the general public got the opportunity to dig into the
roast. That was the first Blockbusteresque film with him at the helm, and it sunk his career in seconds (the
reboot of Frankenstein does NOT count).
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      In a similar vein, a fall from grace is not out of the realm of possibility for the league. By being the first of
the major US franchises to open again (let’s be honest, you can socially distance and still play baseball),
the future of sports in the year 2020 largely hinge upon everything going well. That means keeping
players isolated, testing, and stars engaged, meanwhile presenting the frigging NBA playoffs. Adam
Silver has a <i>stupendously</i> hard task ahead of him, and the weight of his policies and decision will affect
the entertainment in America for months to come.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      If they fail to keep players safe, and we see them continue to test positive for Coronavirus, I doubt we will
see an NFL season. I doubt we will see the NHL or see MLB continue. And I doubt we have any NEW
sports until Baseball begins again in 2021. Adam Silver wants the league to lead the way, and there is
something extraordinarily commendable about trying to lead athletics and entertainment forward. But it is
also worth remembering that everything else hangs in the balance of the success or failure that we are
going to witness unfold in real-time. I am rooting beyond all hope and doubt that we get to see the perfect
product with happy players, enthusiastic media, and an appeased public. And definitely not a huge pile of
crap that I’m dreading we’re all going to watch unfold in real time. Few things have the ability to bring
the country together like sports. Having a rallying cry that we could all get behind would be the perfect
rebound to an otherwise crappy year.
